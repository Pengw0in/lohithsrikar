# I'm **Lohith Srikar**.
### Low-quality polymath  

Sophomore-year computer science student.  
Not really sure what I'm doing â€” but I'm doing *something*.

## What I Actually Do  
- Sometimes build websites 
- Sometimes solve CTFs (and sometimes just stare at them)  
- Sometimes design stuff (figma mostly) 
- Sometimes catch pokÃ©mons for... shiny research?
- Sometimes learn assembly or C/C++ just to suffer

## What Iâ€™m Planning For  
- Learn Redstone craft in Minecraft
- Startout in Bug-Bounty
- Touch grass

## Current Status  
- Learning, experimenting, and probably breaking something right now  
- Probably farming for an Admant [Axew](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/axew)

## Motto  
> *Somewhere, a duck is watching.*

If you're expecting consistency... well, good luck with that ðŸ™‚
